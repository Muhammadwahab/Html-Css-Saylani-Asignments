                                     Geoffrey Boycott OBE (born 21 October 1940) is a former Yorkshire and England cricketer. In a prolific and sometimes controversial playing career from 1962 to 1986, Boycott established himself as one of England's most successful opening batsmen[3] and since retiring as a player, he has found further success as a cricket commentator. Boycott made his international debut in a 1964 Test match against Australia.[4][5] He was noted for his ability to occupy the crease and became a key feature of England's Test batting line up for many years, although he was less successful in his limited One Day International (ODI).

                                     Sir Donald George "Don" Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 â€“ 25 February 2001), often referred to as "The Don", was an Australian cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time.[2] Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport.The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore.[4] Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years.
